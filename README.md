Hello there !
I made this code for my "NSI" projects (it's basically computer science in French high schools) so I never need to check PEP8 by myself.
There are a few things I haven't coded yet such as specifications that can return errors even though it's basically commenting.
Now just decide what you want to do with the time you won't use to check your code !
